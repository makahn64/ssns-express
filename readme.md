MK Notes from 9-2015
====================

Holy shit is this some old school crap right here!

To run the app:  `node www/bin`

To see the app: `localhost:8003`. Why 8003? WTF knows? I cannot remember that far back. 
You can change it in `bin/www`.


MK Notes from 5-2016
====================

Entire leaderboard, game, video app rewritten into 3 distinct Angular controller/view pairs and massively
simplified. All this lives in nissanNgApp. Enjoy the breeze.
